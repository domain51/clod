clod

Ever just get an itch and want to scratch it?  Yeah, us too...  :-)

Clod is (will be) a simple(minded) web framework.  Here's our idea:

    9 times out of 10, you need to start with HTML for a new website, not the
    URLs, not fancy callables, and especially not the models.

Clod provides several routing mechanisms that handle from a simple(minded) as
serving the ``index.html`` from the project root all the way through the
standard webby-MVC framework.

This is licensed under the CDDL.  Our reading (with the IANAL caveat) is that
you use this software however you like, just make sure you give it away under
the same terms.  You don't have to give anything away that runs using this
software, unless you start modifying Clod directly.

Since CDDL isn't compatible with the GPL, we're also allowing you to choose to
use this software under the GPLv3.  If you hate the GPL, learn to love the CDDL,
or feel free to use any of the other great software that's out there. :-)

Why license this way?
"""""""""""""""""""""
Simple, we care most about the freedom of the code.  We learn how to code by
reading more of it, so what is there in making sure that this code and its
derivates stay free?
